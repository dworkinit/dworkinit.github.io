	<h1>Setting Goals for My Site</h1>

	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>Interaction designer <a href="http://www.mathildejacon.com/" target="_blank">Mathilde Jacon's site</a>, and <a href="http://www.momomoyouth.com" target="_blank">Mo's band webpage</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>Both sites effectively use space without overcrowding pages with elements, keeping them simple and speaking through interactivity. Size is used to communicate the importance of information by varying text and image. Pages are balanced as a whole, but some areas had varying weights that created visual interest. Mo's page separated content into sections and used whitespace in between to focus on each content at a time, giving the user a nice visual break as they scroll to the following content. Mathilde had headers and text aligned to the left where viewers eyes would naturally fall, balanced by screenshots of projects to the right.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both landing pages have layouts with a large centered focal point and they effectively use interactivity to engage the viewer as elements move in a fluid fashion. The music site has a stacked layout for content and centers the elements on one page but varies the visual weight with interesting images surrounding the information. The designer's site has separate pages for projects, and uses text size and placement to establish the hierarchy. They differ on the mobile level as Mo maintains its interactiveness while Mathilde's site is a static page with text.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><figure><h3>Home</h3>
			<img src="home.jpg" alt="">
			<figcaption>Played with different focal points between header and circular shape to set the hierarchy. Explored placement across space to see effects on balance. The two on the right are heavier toward the right of the page.</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li><strong>About Us</strong><br>
			<img src="aboutus.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The circular image sets the focal point then establishes hierarchy as you scroll. The mobile version aims to balance elements evenly on a smaller screensize.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Guest Info</strong><br>
			<img src="guestinfo.jpg" alt="">
			<p>This is the most detailed page and the hierarchy begins with the most important content then followed by the rest in order. The challenge is trying to show the information without being overwhelming.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Registry and Contact</strong><br>
			<img src="regandcontact.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The header would be the focal point followed by content for registry and a form for contact information. Played with placement to see if it would be more effective to center content or have it aligned to the left or right.</p></li>	
	</ul>
